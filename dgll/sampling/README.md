### DGLL Sampling

The neighbor sampler plays a key role in creating a subgraph based on the input data. It returns an induced subgraph that directly uses the provided seed nodes as the starting point for sampling.

### Example Usage with `DGLLNeighborSampler`



```python
>>> from dgll.sampling.dgllsampler import DGLLNeighborSampler
>>> from dgll import backend as F

>>> # Load a pre-saved graph from a file
>>> g = pickle.load(open("dgll/dataset/cora.graph", "rb"))

>>> # Define the fan-out for sampling neighbors (2-hop and 3-hop neighbors)
>>> fanout = [2, 3]

>>> # Specify seed nodes for subgraph sampling
>>> seed_nodes = F.tensor([5, 4, 2, 9, 6, 7])

>>> # Initialize the neighbor sampler with the specified fan-out
>>> nsampler = DGLLNeighborSampler(fanout)

>>> # Sample a subgraph based on the seed nodes
>>> input_nodes, seed_nodes, subgs = nsampler.sample(g, seed_nodes)

>>> # Display the input nodes of the sampled subgraph
>>> input_nodes
# tensor([1161,    4,    3,   13,  111,   89,  204,  111,   13,  200,  236,  200,
#          236,  221,   46])

>>> # Display the seed nodes used for sampling
>>> seed_nodes
# tensor([5, 4, 2, 9, 6, 7])

>>> # Display the subgraphs generated by the sampler
>>> subgs
# [<dgll.sampling.base_sampler.Subgraph object at 0x000001A581213580>, 
#  <dgll.sampling.base_sampler.Subgraph object at 0x000001A5812134C0>]

>>> # Access and display the source data of the first subgraph
>>> subgs[0].src_data
# tensor([1161,    4,    3,   13,  111,   89,  204,  111,   13,  200,  236,  200,
#          236,  221,   46])

>>> # Access and display the destination data of the first subgraph
>>> subgs[0].dst_data
# tensor([516, 541, 541, 121, 121, 182, 182, 121, 121,  91,  91, 728, 728,  88,
#         549])

>>> # Access and display the source data of the second subgraph
>>> subgs[1].src_data
# tensor([516, 541,   2, 121, 435,   2, 182, 208, 121,  91, 728,  88, 549])

>>> # Access and display the destination data of the second subgraph
>>> subgs[1].dst_data
# tensor([2, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 9, 6, 6, 6, 7])
```

### Explanation

- **Fan-out Definition:** The fan-out is set to `[2, 3]`, meaning we want to sample 2-hop and 3-hop neighbors.
- **Seed Nodes:** The specific nodes `[5, 4, 2, 9, 6, 7]` are used as the starting points for sampling.
- **Neighbor Sampling:** The `DGLLNeighborSampler` is used to sample a subgraph around the seed nodes.
- **Subgraph Details:** The sampled subgraph's source and destination data are printed for both the first and second layers of neighbors.

This example illustrates how to effectively use the `DGLLNeighborSampler` to sample subgraphs from a larger graph in the `dgll` library.



### Development of Custom Samplers

The `base sampler` modules provides the required contituents for graph sampling, i.e., related classes and methods. 

The `Base_sampler` class provides a foundation for implementing custom graph samplers. It also includes utilities for creating subgraphs and generating neighbors for given nodes.


To implement custom graph samplers, you need to subclass the dgl.sampling.BaseSampler base class and override its abstract sample method. This method should accept the following arguments:

```
def sample(self, g, nodes):
pass
```

- **g**: The original DGLGraph from which to sample.
- **nodes**: The nodes of the current mini-batch.

The function should return the mini-batch of samples.

The code below implements a neighbor sampler:


```
class MyCusomSampler(Base_sampler):
    def __init__(self, fanouts):
      super().__init__()
      self.fanouts = fanouts

    def sample(self, g, seed_nodes):
        output_nodes = seed_nodes
        subgs = []
        print(g, seed_nodes)
        for fanout in reversed(self.fanouts):
            # Sample a fixed number of neighbors of the current seed nodes.
            subg = self.sample_neighbours(g, seed_nodes, fanout)
            seed_nodes = subg.src_nodes()
            subgs.insert(0, subg)
            input_nodes = seed_nodes
        return input_nodes, output_nodes, subgs
```


To use this sampler
```
g = path to g
train_nodeIDs = give training nodes IDs
mysampler =  MyCustomSampler([5, 6])

mydataloader = your data loader with g, train_nodeIDS, and mysampler

for i, input_nodes, output_nodes, subgs in enumerate(mydataloader):
  trainMyGNN(input_nodes, output_nodes, subgs)
```
